# Goodreads Copy Book Info

A userscript that adds a convenient "Copy Info" button to Goodreads book pages.

## Prerequisites

This script requires a userscript manager extension to be installed in your browser. We recommend using **Violentmonkey**.

### Installing Violentmonkey

1. **Chrome**: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
2. **Firefox**: [irefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
3. **Edge**: [Microsoft Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)

## Installation

### Method 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Ensure you have Violentmonkey installed in your browser
2. Navigate to the raw script URL on GitHub:
   ```
   https://github.com/LaurinSorgend/goodreadsCopyInfoButton/raw/main/get_book_info.js
   ```
3. Violentmonkey should automatically detect the script and prompt you to install it
4. Click "Confirm installation"



## Output Format

This currently copies the info with *weird* tabs in it (because that's how I need it for my google sheet) but you can change it for how you need it by simply editing line 138.
